# Connext Browser SDK
The Connext Browser SDK is the simplest possible way to enable p2p micropayments on any webpage.

Connext is the protocol for p2p micropayments, built with state channels on Ethereum and other EVM blockchains. This SDK creates a Connext client inside of an iframe in your browser page, and then uses that client and some minimal UI components to dispatch transfers.

The SDK supports the following features:
- ðŸ“¨ Email-based logins via [Magic.Link](https://magic.link).
- ðŸ’³ Debit card on/offboarding via ________.
- â›½ End-to-end Ethereum gas (transaction fee) abstraction.
- ðŸ’µ Transfers denoted in USD, with optional customizeability to other currencies.
- ðŸ¦Š Support for Ethereum wallets such as [Metamask](https://metamask.io). (coming soon!)
