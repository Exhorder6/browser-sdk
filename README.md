# Connext Browser SDK
The Connext Browser SDK is the simplest way to add micropayments to any web app.

Connext is the protocol for p2p micropayments, built with state channels on Ethereum and other EVM blockchains. This SDK creates a Connext client inside of an iframe in your browser page, and then uses that client and some minimal UI components to dispatch transfers.

The SDK supports the following features:
- ðŸ“¨ Email-based logins by default via [Magic.Link](https://magic.link).
- ðŸ’³ Debit card on/offboarding via ________.
- â›½ End-to-end Ethereum gas (transaction fee) abstraction.
- ðŸ’µ Transfers denoted in USD, with optional customizeability to other currencies.
- ðŸ¦Š Logins using any popular Ethereum wallet such as [Metamask](https://metamask.io). (coming soon!)

## Installation
You can install the SDK using npm:

```bash
npm i connext
```

## Quick Start
After installing, import the SDK into your web app and then instantiate it.
```javascript
import * as SDK from 'connext';

const sdk = new SDK();
```
Note that by default the sdk will spin up in `sandbox` mode on the Rinkeby Ethereum testnet. You will be able to create and send transactions, but they will not use real money. To send real-world value, you can instantiate the sdk in `production` mode:

```javascript
const sdk = new SDK('production')
```
You can pop open the login UI using:
```javascript
await sdk.login();
```

And then do the same with deposit:
```javascript
await sdk.deposit();
```
